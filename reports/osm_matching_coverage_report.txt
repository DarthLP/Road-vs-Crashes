  cycleway       :   1.1%
  sidewalk       :  10.3%

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the analysis:

1. CRASH DATA (91% match rate):
   - Excellent match rate for road safety analysis
   - 10m threshold is appropriate
   - Unmatched crashes likely in parking lots or off-road areas

2. IMAGE DATA (45% match rate for Berlin):
   - Match rate is reasonable for comprehensive street-level imagery
   - Unmatched images include parks, water, plazas, courtyards
   - Increasing to 25m threshold would add only ~7% more matches
   - Consider: Keep 10m for precision, or use 25m for broader coverage

3. OSM COVERAGE:
   - Road network appears comprehensive (190k segments, 12k km)
   - Good attribute coverage for infrastructure analysis
   - Missing data is expected (footpaths, private roads)

4. ANALYSIS APPROACH:
   - Focus on matched data for road infrastructure analysis
   - Unmatched images provide context for non-road environments
   - Consider separate analyses for Berlin vs Brandenburg

8. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The OSM matching process successfully enriched:
  - 88,992 crashes with road infrastructure attributes
  - 34,286 images with road infrastructure attributes

Match rates reflect the reality that:
  - Crashes occur predominantly on roads (91% match rate)
  - Street-level imagery includes diverse environments (45% match rate)
  - OSM provides comprehensive road network coverage for Berlin

The enriched datasets are ready for infrastructure-aware crash analysis.
